        Understanding Stablecoins and Recent U.S. Legislation
      </h1>

      <p>
        A <strong>stablecoin</strong> is a type of cryptocurrency that is
        designed to maintain a stable value by pegging its price to a reserve
        asset—most commonly the U.S. dollar. Unlike highly volatile
        cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin or Ethereum, stablecoins aim to combine
        the benefits of digital currency with the price stability of fiat money.
      </p>

      <p>There are several types of stablecoins:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Fiat-collateralized:</strong> Backed by cash or cash
          equivalents held in reserves (e.g., USDC, USDT).
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Crypto-collateralized:</strong> Backed by other
          cryptocurrencies and often overcollateralized to absorb volatility
          (e.g., DAI).
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Algorithmic:</strong> Maintain value using on-chain algorithms
          and incentive mechanisms, though these are more experimental and have
          faced stability issues.
        </li>
      </ul>

        Recent U.S. Senate Bill on Stablecoins
      </h2>

      <p>
        In a significant regulatory move, the United States Senate recently
        passed a bill focused on the regulation of stablecoins. The legislation
        aims to bring greater clarity and security to the issuance and oversight
        of dollar-backed digital assets.
      </p>

      <p>Key provisions of the bill include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Federal registration and oversight for stablecoin issuers.</li>
        <li>
          Mandatory 1:1 backing of stablecoins with high-quality liquid assets
          (such as U.S. dollars or Treasury securities).
        </li>
        <li>Regular auditing and public transparency requirements.</li>
        <li>Clear consumer protections and redemption rights for holders.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        The bill’s passage marks a major step toward legitimizing stablecoins in
        the U.S. financial system and could pave the way for broader
        institutional adoption. It also places pressure on major issuers to
        comply with stricter reporting and reserve standards, increasing public
        trust in regulated stablecoin products.
      </p>

      <h2 style={{ marginTop: "2rem" }}>Why Stablecoins Matter</h2>

      <p>
        Stablecoins play a critical role in the cryptocurrency ecosystem. They
        are commonly used for trading, remittances, decentralized finance
        (DeFi), and as a bridge between traditional finance and blockchain-based
        applications. Their utility depends heavily on trust, transparency, and
        liquidity.
      </p>

      <p>
        With formal regulation, stablecoins are more likely to be integrated
        into mainstream financial products, potentially influencing everything
        from global payments to central bank digital currency (CBDC) policy.
