      <h1>Understanding Decentralized Applications (dApps)</h1>
      <p>
        Decentralized applications, or dApps, are software programs that run on
        a blockchain network instead of centralized servers. They rely on smart
        contracts—self-executing code stored on the blockchain—to carry out core
        functions without the need for intermediaries.
      </p>
      <p>
        Unlike traditional apps controlled by a single entity, dApps operate on
        decentralized platforms like Ethereum, Solana, or Polygon. This means no
        single party has control over the system, increasing transparency and
        resistance to censorship.
      </p>
      <p>
        dApps are used in various sectors including finance (DeFi), gaming,
        digital art (NFTs), and governance (DAOs). Examples include Uniswap for
        decentralized trading, Aave for crypto lending, and OpenSea for buying
        and selling NFTs.
      </p>
      <p>
        Key advantages of dApps include increased user control, transparency,
        security, and global accessibility. However, they also face challenges
        like scalability, complex interfaces, and evolving regulatory
        environments.
